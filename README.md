# Pipex Tester

This repository contains a simple tester for the Pipex project.

## Usage

To use the tester, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or paste the `tester_pipex.sh` script inside your Pipex project folder:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jmehmy42/Pipex_tester
    ```

    Or manually copy `tester_pipex.sh` into your project folder.

2. Run the script with bash:
    ```bash
    bash tester_pipex.sh
    ```

3. The script will create an `infile` and check the output in the `log` file.

## Notes

Happy testing!
